# Final_exam_CS2118
This repository provides the written code in with which we have completed all 3 tasks by Aiken, Sofiya, Adina, Irina, Assylbek.
(The code from linux terminal has this sign: ~, that making strikethrough text in github, so we deleted this signs here. Unfortunately, some of the written codes have not been saved.)\

# Task 2 code
1. "Direct" IP connection\
In the manual configuration mode of the IPv4 in wired connection entered this settings:\
Address: 10.0.2.15\
Netmask: 255.255.255.0 \
Gateway: 10.0.2.2\
DNS: 162.168.1.1 (IPv4 address of my home router)\
Checked results in settins and in terminal by typing commands:\
sonya@sonya:$ ip addr \
sonya@sonya:$ ping google.com (this test checks the speed and stability of the entered internet connection)\
2.	Connection via NAT.\
a) To connect via NAT, I used Iptables & to do it I had to get root access.\
b) First of all, I verified my connection, then configured eth0 with an IP external network and configured eth1 for LAN with an internal private network.\
a)	Gateway, DNS configuration.\
b)	Then, I did NAT configuration via IP tables:\
Deleted and flashed, also deleted all chains (that are not included to default filter & nat table).\
Set up IP forwarding and masquerading.\
Enabled packet forwarding & applied the configuration.\

# Final_exam_CS2118
This repository provides the written code in with which we have completed all 3 tasks by Aiken, Sofiya, Adina, Irina, Assylbek. With some explanations, more in report file.
(The code from linux terminal has this signs: ~, #, these making strikethrough and marked up text in github, so we removed these signs here in some places. Unfortunately, some of the written codes have not been saved.)\

## Task 2 codes
**1. "Direct" IP connection**\
In the manual configuration mode of the IPv4 in wired connection entered this settings:\
*Address: 10.0.2.15\
Netmask: 255.255.255.0 \
Gateway: 10.0.2.2\
DNS: 162.168.1.1 (IPv4 address of my home router)*\
Checked results in settins and in terminal by typing commands:\
sonya@sonya:$ ip addr \
sonya@sonya:$ ping google.com (this test checks the speed and stability of the entered internet connection)\
**2.	Connection via NAT.**\
a) To connect via NAT, I used Iptables & to do it I had to get root access.\
b) First of all, I verified my connection, then configured eth0 with an IP external network and configured eth1 for LAN with an internal private network.\
a)	Gateway, DNS configuration.\
b)	Then, I did NAT configuration via IP tables:\
Deleted and flashed, also deleted all chains (that are not included to default filter & nat table).\
Set up IP forwarding and masquerading.\
Enabled packet forwarding & applied the configuration.\
In the /etc/systl.conf *\
/etc/sysctl.conf - Configuration ftle for setting system vartables\
 See /etc/sysctl.d/ for additional system vartables.\
 See sysctl.conf (5) for information.\
#kernel.domainname = example.com\
 Uncomment the following to stop low-level messages on console\
kernel.printk = 3 4 1 3\
#######＃############＃＃＃＃＃##＃#＃###########＃#######＃###＃#＃#＃＃＃＃＃＃丼＃#＃\
 Functions previously found in netbase\
 Uncomment the next two lines to enable spoof protection (reverse-path filter)\
 Turn on Source Address Verification in all interfaces to\
 prevent some spoofing attacks\
#net.tpv4.conf.default.rp_ filter=1\
#net.tpv4.conf.all.rp_filter=1\
In the /etc/networks/interfaces\
pre-up iptables-restore < /etc/iptables.up.rules\
up route add -net 192.168.0.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 dev eth1\
up route add -net 0.0.0.0 netmask 255.255.255.255 dev eth0\
**3.	Connectian via a Proxy server.**\
For this type of connection method, I used information from special sites that give out up-to-date proxy servers, to do this work I used a Singapore server. 
*I connected everything manually.\
a) I went straight into Wired Connected -> Wired Settings -> Wired and clicked on the  Network Proxy button (by that I turned on whole system of proxy, because it was previously disabled).\
b) Then, I entered all essential data:\
HTTP Proxy: 180.210.206.52\
HTTPS Proxy: 180.210.206.52\
FTP Proxy: 180.210.206.52\
Port, that I’ve entered everywhere: 3128\
c) Then, I used terminal to check the quality of the network connection.\
sonya@sonya:$ ping google.com\
PING google.com (142.250.74.46) 50(84) bytes of data.\
64 bytes from arn09s22-in-f14.1e100.net (142.250.74.46): icmp_seq=1 ttl=56 time=160ms\
64 bytes from arn09s22-in-f14.1e100.net (142.250.74.46): icmp_seq=2 ttl=56 time=132ms\
64 bytes from arn09s22-in-f14.1e100.net (142.250.74.46): icmp_seq=3 ttl=56 time=164ms\
64 bytes from arn09s22-in-f14.1e100.net (142.250.74.46): icmp_seq=4 ttl=56 time=179ms\
Overall, people use proxy servers because it offers several benefits, such as: security, privacy and access to restricted content.
## Task 3 codes
1) Loading modprobe, insmod and depmod distributions for working with module packages with:\
aika@aika-virtual-machine:$ sudo apt-get install build-essential kmod\
Сheck which modules are loaded into the kernel via:\
aika@aika-virtual-machine:$ sudo lsmod\
Prescribed the path to the modules:\
aika@aika-virtual-machine:$ sudo cat /proc/modules \
Through these commands we check the available cores:\
aika@aika-virtual-machine:$ sudo apt-get update \
aika@aika-virtual-machine:$ apt-cache search linux-headers-`uname -r` \

2) After that we download the latest version of the kernel:\
aika@aika-virtual-machine:$ sudo apt-get install kmod linux-headers-5.4.0-80-generic\

3) We create a text catalog calculator-2.ko with mkdir command\
aika@aika-virtual-machine: $ mkdir -p ~/develop/kernel/calculator-2\

4) Then we upload the C code with the calculator there:\
```
#include <linux/init.h>
#include <linux/module.h>
#include <linux/kernel.h>
int calculator_init(void) {
    printk(KERN_INFO "Calculator module loaded\n");
    char op;
    int num1, num2;

    // Read operator and operands from user
    printk(KERN_INFO "Enter operator (+,-,*,/): ");
    scanf("%c", &op);
    printk(KERN_INFO "Enter two operands: ");
    scanf("%d %d", &num1, &num2);
    // Perform the operation
    switch(op) {
        case '+':
            printk(KERN_INFO "%d + %d = %d\n", num1, num2, num1 + num2);
            break;
        case '-':
            printk(KERN_INFO "%d - %d = %d\n", num1, num2, num1 - num2);
            break;
        case '*':
            printk(KERN_INFO "%d * %d = %d\n", num1, num2, num1 * num2);
            break;
        case '/':
            if(num2 == 0) {
                printk(KERN_ERR "Error: Division by zero\n");
            } else {
                printk(KERN_INFO "%d / %d = %d\n", num1, num2, num1 / num2);
            }
            break;
        default:
            printk(KERN_ERR "Error: Invalid operator\n");
            break;
    }
    return 0;
}
void calculator_exit(void) {
    printk(KERN_INFO "Calculator module unloaded\n");
}
module_init(calculator_init);
module_exit(calculator_exit);
MODULE_LICENSE("GPL");
MODULE_AUTHOR("Your name");
MODULE_DESCRIPTION("A simple calculator kernel module");
```
5) Next we create a Makefile with text editor nano\
aika@aika-virtual-machine: $ cd ~/develop/kernel/calculator-2\
aika@aika-virtual-machine: ~/develop/kernel/calculator-2$ nano Makefile\

6) At the end, we execute the make command\
aika@aika-virtual-machine: ~/develop/kernel/calculator-2$ make\

7) Next we run our sudo insmod calculator-2.ko file and test it with simple calculation\
aika@aika-virtual-machine: ~/develop/kernel/calculator-2$ sudo insmod calculator-2.ko\
aika@aika-virtual-machine: ~/develop/kernel/calculator-2$ 23 - 13\
